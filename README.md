# Dressed-4-Weds-Backend

Dressed4Weds is an Ecommerce website for wedding attire. It handles user authentication, product management, and shopping cart functionality. This project is built using the MERN stack, combining MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

This backend contains the logic for user creation and login, product management and basic cart functions. It uses the following technolgies:

- Mongoose
- Cors
- JWT Tokens
- Bcyrpt
- Morgan

Dressed 4 Weds Backend is the API I will be using for an upcoming website! This is my first shot at an Ecommerce website using any stack. I am getting used to doing full-stack development using MERN stack again and this was a great challenge to start again. Thank you for taking the time to check out my project!
